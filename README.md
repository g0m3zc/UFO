## Project Overview
Overview of the UFO Analysis
This project consisted of using Javascript and HTML to create a webpage that links to a datasource for UFO sightings.  We were able to add filters so that the user can view the rows of data of interest to them.

## Results
Using the site at  https://g0m3zc.github.io/UFO/

Users can use the filters on the left side of the page to filter the table results.  This is done by typing in the search criteria into the box.  Once enter is clicked, or after you click out of the box, the fitler will update.

## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
One drawback of this design is that it relies on the ability of the user to be able to spell correctly and delete out the filters to reset the page.  I would recommend to do a dropdown list where possible so that it is easier for the user to get the information they are looking for.  I would also recommend a reset filters button that would clear out the filters that are applied on a page.

Another drawback is that the filters are currently case sensitive.  It would be helpful to apply a function that changes all the text entered to lower case so that the user will see the results regardless of case.
